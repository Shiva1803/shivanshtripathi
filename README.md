# Shivansh Tripathi - Portfolio

My personal portfolio and blog, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features interactive visualizations, technical writing on AI and aerospace engineering, and a custom Mandelbrot set explorer. The site showcases my projects, thoughts on technology, and experiments with data visualization—all wrapped in a clean, responsive design with dark mode support.
